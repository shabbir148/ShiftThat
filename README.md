# ShiftThat
 Bidding application for loading and unloading which we give name ShifThat. This is a web application where people can put advertisements about items that they want to shift. Transport people will make bids  for those items. And the lowest bidder will get the deal. This application creates a win-win situation for both service provider and customer. 


# React-Bidding-System

## React-express-websocket based Bidding system

This single Page application is a combination of React App and an API server written in Express.

WebSockets api socket.io is used to update the bid history and bidding time in real time.

React App is created using 'create-react-app', it automates the build of the app and the environment will have everything to build a modern React app.

# Running Application
Install node and npm globally.
## Running API Server
Open command prompt or git bash navigate to project folder.

    cd React-Bidding-System
First grab the dependencies with npm:

    npm install
   
Then run the app:

    npm start

## Running React App
Navigate to client folder inside the project.

     cd React-Bidding-System/client
     
First grab the dependencies with npm:

    npm install
 
Then run the app: 

    npm start
  
and navigate to http://localhost:3000/

Note: make sure to start API server before React App.

        
  ## Data
  
 JSON files are used as dataLayer instead of a Database just for implementation easiness. In real Time a database is more efficient than a file system . livestock_details.json and bid_history.json are files used to read and write necessary data.
